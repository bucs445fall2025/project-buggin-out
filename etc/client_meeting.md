### What are the costs vs budget?
The only cost is development time. We are unpaid laborers. 
### What is the timeframe?
We will have a finished product within 3 months
### What problem are you trying to solve?
People don't track what they eat throughout the week, or even everyday. We are trying to create a web app that will help people find recipes online, and track their meals and plan ahead for the week. 
        Make sure you identify the actual problem, not the perceived problem.
### What is the most important feature?
We can use the gemini api to give personalized weekly meal plans. We can probably add a feature for students to plan out their weekly meals according to the dining halls. Or if they want to just use it for their personal meal tracking and what not thats cool too.
### Is there a similar product on the market?
 We are kind of adding features that pertain to binghamton students but not fully focusing on them as our intended audience, it should be accessible for anyone trying to meal prep or figure out what theyve been eating. Give some diet feedback depending on macros at the end of the week. If they went over daily allowed amounts.
### Are there any existing products or technologies that need to be integrated?
we will be using a PERN stack, we will implement gemini API. 
### What does success look like?
clients who are happy with our app and will spread the word to their friends. More users,
### What risks are associated with a malicious user?
A malicious user can probably overwhelm our server with requests faster than it can process, leading to slowdowns and potential server crashes that lead to our site being down.
we just have to be vigilant to not console log crucial information.
### What is the lifetime of this software?
It will probably be fully operational until gemini stops being free. After that most of our built in features will work

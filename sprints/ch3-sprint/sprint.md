# **Project Overview**

## **Application Vision/Goal:**
This application will enable users to find, save, and plan meals easily. It will help users organize their meals for the week, generate grocery lists, and share recipes with friends or family.We will probably have 2 kinds of application experiences, one for students who are trying to map out a plan for the week, and one for people who are trying to find new recipes to try out and cook for themselves, mainly people off campus.

## **Scope:**
It needs to be able to allow the user to create an account or sign in. Allow the user to search for recipes or browse through them in a grid. Users should be able to save recipes that they found, and they can add their own so that they are able to create a weekly meal plan. We can have summaries of each days meals with nutrition facts. At the end of the week you can get an email based on your meals. The user should be able to generate a grocery list based on the meals they have planned for the week. The user should be able to share recipes with other users. 

## **Deliverables:**
[List what will be delivered by the end of the project, such as a working MVP (Minimum Viable Product), specific features, documentation, etc.]
By the end of the projcet we will have a functioning app that will prompt users to create an account, choose what kind of user they are, and then go from there. The main features like meal tracking and finding recipes via API should be done farily quickly so not a concern. Entire process will be documented.

## **Success Criteria:**
meet every week. make sure we discuss what we did, what we plan to do and when we plan to do it. Help eachother figure out bugs and problems. Stay on top of the weekly sprint schedules.
## **Assumptions:**
[List any assumptions about the technology, users, or resources that could impact development.]
Assumptions for users include them either using it for personal use or school-based use. We aren't catering to business use. We are using free API's so we are assuming they will stay free.

## **Risks:**
[Identify potential risks and challenges, such as technical limitations, resource constraints, or dependency issues.]
We are using technolgoies that some of us aren't fluent in so if we need help we can't rely on eachother and might need to pursue external options.

## **Design / Architectural Review:**
[Outline the initial thoughts on application architecture. Will it be monolithic or microservices? Will it use a database? What major components will be included?]

## **Test Environment:**
[Define how the application will be tested. Will you use automated tests? What environment will the tests run in?]

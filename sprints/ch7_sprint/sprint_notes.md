### The summary of the entire project

The project now has a pretty decent UI layout with an API (spoonacular) now implemented into the backend (we know it pulls the data). Macrotracker uses the API and has been refined.  
The user is now able to fill out the sign up page and have their data saved in a database for retrieval.
